#Missing Treasure Collage

Created by the 2014 Missing Venice team for the Venice IQP.

##Live Link:
This project is live [here](http://jlleitschuh.github.io/MissingVenice-MissingTreasuresCollage/).

##Dependency Management:
Dependency management is through bower. If you want to add external libraries please download [bower](http://bower.io/).

##Syntax Notes:

###Defining an object:
Object names should have the first letter capitalized and proceed with camel case.

```javascript
function AnObject(name){
	this.name = name;
}
```
###Defining a function:
Function names should have the first letter lower case and proceed with camel case.

```javascript
function aFunction(data){
	//do something
}
```
It is clearer if your function takes a dictionary instead a list of paramaters. This makes it easier to read the code.
